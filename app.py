Act as a Software Architect & Generate Bullet Point Answers in Crisp One to Two Lines Max.
Based on the provided software architecture diagram, analyze the following aspects:
1. Identify any potential flaws or inefficiencies in the architecture.
2. Assess adherence to best practices such as SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and Microservices.
3. Suggest improvements in modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
4. Identify security vulnerabilities and recommend mitigations.
5. Evaluate technology stack and suggest alternative frameworks/languages if needed.
6. Analyze API structure and suggest improvements for efficiency and interoperability.
7. Assess scalability and performance under high-load conditions.
8. Recommend DevOps strategies for CI/CD, monitoring, and automated testing.
9. Identify bottlenecks in data flow and suggest optimization techniques.
10. Determine if the architecture follows industry standards and compliance guidelines.
